# RV32I implementation on TL-Verilog
RISC-V RV32I ISA Implementation on TL-Verilog. Constructed as a result of taking the course: LFD111x: Building a RISC-V CPU Core

#### RISC-V.tlv v/s RISC-V_CPU.tlv 
This RISC-V file presents the full implementation of chapter 4 while RISC-V_CPU is the implementation of chapter 5 of the course, so, the code on the first file es reduced version of the RV32I ISA, and the code in the second file is a complete implementation of the RV32I ISA. 

#### Usage
To use the code you can simply just copy and paste it into [makerchip](https://makerchip.com/)

#### Acknowledgments
This STEM research school work was carried out in my current capacity as a high school student in Chile (2022).
